## What It Does

- **Build Your Collection:**  
  Easily add albums to your collection using a search tool that connects to Spotify. You can browse album covers, read details, and add them with just a tap.

- **View & Organize Albums:**  
  See all your albums in a clear grid view. Tap on an album to see more details, adjust its rating with a star system, or leave a personal comment.  
  - **Swipe to Delete:** Quickly remove albums from a list by swiping left.  
  - **Swipe to Export:** Generate a shareable export of a list by swiping right.

- **Create Custom Lists:**  
  Organize your albums into custom lists. Whether you want to create a list for road trips or relaxing evenings, adding or removing albums from lists is simple and intuitive.

- **Discover Statistics:**  
  Get insights about your music habits with charts that show your average ratings, how many albums are in each list, and more. Albums and genres in the statistics are computed based on the *weighted score of individual tracks* (so your most-played or highest-ranked tracks have a bigger impact). You can also see your top tracks, artists, and genres based on your Spotify listening history.

- **Spotify Integration:**  
  Connect your Spotify account to see your top tracks and artists. You can even open albums directly in Spotify to listen to them.
